# Hoka-Experiment
doing experiment on Hoka running shoes and document


Recently I bought a pair of Hoka shoes, which have a great reputation among both health-oriented and athletic-minded enthusiasts.
Even though there are mixed opinions about their durability, very few people have actually documented shoe performance over time.
This project interested me because we know that idiosyncratic differences—such as running style, stride, and gait—cause the outsole to wear differently from person to person.
What was even more frustrating is that when I approached retailers and asked if they had ever come across cases where the Hoka outsole padding came off within the first 200 miles, they insisted they had never seen such a case.
They made it sound like my situation was the only one on record.
So I decided to run a small experiment with two purposes: first, to connect with athletes who have had the same experience with Hoka outsoles; and second, to document how the outsole wears over time.
I do not know whether this will prove or helpful in raising awareness, but it may shed light on something the manufacturers are overlooking.
